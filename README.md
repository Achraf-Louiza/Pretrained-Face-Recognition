# Pretrained-Face-Recognition
We will be using "face_recognition" python library (based on dlib) to explore the different steps of face recognition:

- Image transformation: HOG (Histogram of oriented gradients)
- Face detection: Sliding machine learning classifier
- Face landmarks detection: Multiple ML algorithms
- Face alignment: Affine transformation
- Face encoding: Encoding image into vectors with unique measurements of a person
- Face recognition: Distance calculations with image in DB to find the concerned person.
